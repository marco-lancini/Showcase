Showcase is a REST-based webservice developed for the "Service Technologies" course at **Politecnico di Milano** during my second year of Master.



## Create, collaborate, share.
##### Create beautiful projects.
Showcase allows you to expose all your creations in a single place: create your personal professional portfolio.

##### Share them to the world.
Thanks to the strong interconnection between Showcase and social networks, you can increase the visibility of your projects and get in touch with other professionals just like you.

##### Collaborate with other experts.
As special feature, Showcase offers a service that automatically finds the best professionals around you that can help you carrying on your projects.
